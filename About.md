Hi, I'm Ivan.  
I am a bioinformatics scientist with a background in chemistry, cell biology, and drug development.  
My experience, skills, and education are described in detail in my [Curriculum Vitae][CV], as well as briefly in my [Résumé][resume].  
As I am a scientist, one can also certainly find me on [Google Scholar][scholar] and [Research Gate][rgate].

Currently, I work for [Rancho BioSciences][rancholink] at the [National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences][ncatslink] in Maryland.
